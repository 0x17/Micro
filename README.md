* initCallback - called once after everything was setup.
* drawCallback - callback is called each frame.

quit - close application

* name - name of .png file (w/out extension) in "data/" path.
* rz - rotation around z-axis in degrees CCW.
* sx - scaling factor along x-axis.
* sy - scaling factor along y-axis.

getImageDim(name) - dimensions of image (w,h) in pixels

#### Font
setFont(name, size) - set font for subsequent drawText calls.
* name - name of .ttf file (w/out extension) in "data/" path.
* size - size of font for subsequent drawText calls.
